The air is thick with the smells of ale, roasted meat, and something mustier you can't quite place. You find yourself jostled in the crowded common room of The Drunken Gryphon, a famed tavern in the heart of Waterdeep. Around you, patrons roar with laughter, slam mugs on tables, and tell tales both tall and true. \n\nAcross the table, a figure stirs, their face obscured by the wide brim of a worn leather hat. They shift in their seat, a movement that jingles with the faint whisper of chainmail beneath their dark cloak.\n\n\"Aye,\" a gruff voice rumbles from beneath the hat, \"Heard every word. You new in town?\" \n"

You some kind of bard, talking in circles like that?\"  He eyes you with a mixture of amusement and suspicion. \n\n\"Look, if you're looking for work, you gotta tell me what you're good at.  Can you swing a sword?  Pick a lock? Talk a dragon out of its hoard?  Give me something to work with here.\" \n"
